# Horizon Enterprise Aircraft Assessment Insights

## Overview

This projects analyzes the avaiation accidents since 1962, which contains informations about civil aviation accidents within the United States, its territories and in international waters. Insights from the analysis will enable Horizon Enterprise to identify safe, low-risk aircraft for Horizon Ventures, minimize operational risks, reduce negative publicity, and support the company's expansion into the aviation industry by ensuring safer, more reliable fleet acquisitions.

## Business Problem

Horizon Enterprises is seeking to expand into the Aviation and Aerospace Industry,specifically the Aircraft Operations and Fleet management as a means of diversifying their portfolio. The goal is to ensure business continuity, minimize financial risks, and optimize fleet performance.

## Data

The National Transportation Safety Board,an independent U.S. government agency responsible for investigating and determining the probable causes of transportation accidents, provides information from 1962 and later about civil aviation accidents within United States, its territories and in internation waters. The data files provide the event dates, location, aircraft category, make, model as well as other plane features.

## Methods

In this project, we use descriptive analysis to explore historical data on aircraft performance, accident rates, and safety records. This allows for the identification of key trends and patterns in aircraft reliability and safety outcomes over time
